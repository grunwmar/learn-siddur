# עם ישראל חי 
This is my training sidur intended for my leargning prayers and blessings. I am learning gradually which means, 
I have marked parts which is good to learn at first and through the time step by step add 
the rest of the texts. 

I am sorry if someone is feeling offended by this partitioning of sidur, but it is my way to learn. Purpose of this is purely for my education.
